Day 1: Docker Compose and the Eternal questions about Databases, 8/19/2022
        Today the question about how our song request app would be built came out in full force.
    Micro-services V Monoliths, module one concepts re-introduced as design issues.  They said
    it would happen, and it has.  For the scope of this project keeping the accounts and the request
    features inside of a single django architecture makes sense.
        We just hope that the two DATABASE_URL definitions work and are accessible in the Django project.
