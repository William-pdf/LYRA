Day 1: Docker Compose and the Eternal questions about Databases, 8/19/2022
        Today the question about how our song request app would be built came out in full force.
    Micro-services V Monoliths, module one concepts re-introduced as design issues.  They said
    it would happen, and it has.  For the scope of this project keeping the accounts and the request
    features inside of a single django architecture makes sense.
        We just hope that the two DATABASE_URL definitions work and are accessible in the Django project.


Day 2: Postgres quick fix(bandaid fix, need to solve real problem(the bathman?))
    I don't know why the docker compose is not creating my databases.
But whatever I can have someone look at the composition of the whole thing later.
even though I barely know any SQL, I just got into the terminal and made some databases.
I made some users and set them as owners.  Now I can start working on the meat and potatoes of this whole thing.  I need to remember to get a more specific walk-through of the docker compose and where everything is connecting.
