# Day 1

Today we decided on a band approach to our project and started taking steps towards our design .

## Day 2 

I worked with Carter and Matt to find how we wanted to approach our project and models we decided to use a microservice approach with multiplice databases and options for the users for finance. 

## Day 3 

We were able to figure out which site direction we wanted to take and changed into a monolith and decided to make our band management app more song request oriented.
