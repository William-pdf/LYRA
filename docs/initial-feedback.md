## Initial Feedback 

### Project idea
I think this is an awesome idea and as a concert goer have wanted such an app many times. At this point, I think that doing anything around song-writing or finances probably outside the scope of what this application does. For stretch goals I would focus on extra features directly related to song-requests and/or play-list management.

### Scope of work
As mentioned above, I would confine the scope to song-requests and play-list management. The scope for the song-request features looks good, but I would define some stretch goals that are specific to that segment.

### Docs
The docs on your gitlab site aren't quite where there should be. I don't expect them to be complete (how could they be at this point...?) but you ought to get the 4 pages setup and get what you have in there. I would also make sure to do wireframes of your pages 

For your benefit, keep those up-to date as you make decisions and refine your designs. Use your `integrations.md` file to keep track of any useful information that you find about setting-up and configuring the integrations. These can be a pain to figure out sometimes, document it so it is easy for your other team members and for you later when you forget... If you all use these docs as THE place that you put any and all documentation about your project, it will be easier for you all to stay on the same page.
